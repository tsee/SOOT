Wrapper / guts:
- Implement global function wrapping
- Implement method caching
- Implement can()
- Fix Color_t lookup and other primitive types
- Implement casting
- Investigate wrapping all/more enums
- Investigate array conversion vs. memory
- Investigate references
- Implement TTree/Branch (arguments-as-return-values)

Packaging:
- Investigate ROOT's build system and how SOOT could be integrated
  without sacrificing CPAN-installation. (Specifically, investigate
  inlining of dependencies.)

Documentation / UI:
- Convert a few examples and fix the ensuing madness.
- ROOTSYS/tutorials to comply with Rene's requirements for inclusion.

Testing:
- Much, much more testing...
- Specifically expose more guts via SOOT::API for unit testing.
