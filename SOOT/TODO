Conceptual issues:
- This was changed to use ROOT-level inheritance for ROOT
  classes. But the problem of not being able to inject methods
  into ROOT classes from Perl and having them inherited remains
  to be solved, so the text is left in here as a reference:

  Since we set up the inheritance at the Perl side,
  explicitly materialized methods of superclasses will
  take precedence over overridden (virtual) methods in
  subclasses that need to go through the AUTOLOAD
  mechanism. If we didn't set up the inheritance that way
  we'd lose out on optimizing one Fill() method explicitly
  in TH1 and would have to explicitly propagate that to the
  subclasses. Alternatively, we could ditch the Perl-side
  inheritance and entirely rely on the method dispatch in
  C++/ROOT's RTTI. This would almost certainly require some
  automatic materialization in order to avoid having to alias
  lots of manual method implementations all over the place.
  Unfortunately, I don't currently feel confident that I
  remember all issues related to the current inheritance
  setup. On the upside, the class generation code that sets
  up inheritance now by setting @ISA can already handle
  method generation. Things to consider:
  - Automatic materialization
  - Inheriting (in Perl) from a ROOT class?
  - $foo->can("bar") which isn't implemented at all right now
  - ...

Wrapper / guts:
- Refactor global function wrapping
- Implement method caching
  => Implemented for struct accessors
  => Needs implementation for the general case
  ===> Implementation for non-overloaded methods that either just checks
       the number of arguments or at least just checks the SPECIFIC types
       of the arguments (without going via the expensive prototype calculation)
  ===> Implementation for overloaded methods. Can be optimized to break out of
       a validation loop based in argument types.
- Implement can()
- Fix Color_t lookup and other primitive types
  (Note: I might have fixed this by accident. SetLineColor(int) now works. Does GetLineColor?)
- Investigate wrapping all/more enums
- Investigate references
- Implement TTree/Branch (arguments-as-return-values)
- Implement TList? / TFile::GetListOfKeys? => see examples/Basic/bill.pl 
- Assignment operators
  => Specifically, consider "gRandom = new TRandom(...);" in C.
     There is no equivalent in Perl beacuse "$gRandom = TRandom->new()" will
     just overwrite the Perl object and the ROOT objects will internally
     use the C-level gRandom which is no longer referenced by $gRandom.
  => General solution is a proper cross-language memory
     management / ownership setup (PyROOT?)
  => Reasonably simple stop-gap solution would be, for example, to
     overload CODE dereferencing for TObjects to behave as assignment operators.
     The above C code could become: "$gRandom->(...)".
  ====> While mostly implemented now, this still fails on the const qualifier. Doh.
- Either lose the silly overloading or add string overloading to get the refaddr
  (If so, add bool overloading, too)

Packaging:
- Investigate ROOT's build system and how SOOT could be integrated
  without sacrificing CPAN-installation. (Specifically, investigate
  inlining of dependencies.)
  => Works locally, but is really hacky.
  => Problems with how a tree of files can be installed by the same means
     as the rest of ROOT. Need hookable "make install" target.
- Convert to using Module::Build::WithXSpp
- Use ExtUtils::Typemap::* instead of shipping perlobject.map, etc

Documentation / UI:
- Convert more examples and fix the ensuing madness.
- Check existing examples/ for FIXME's.
- ROOTSYS/tutorials to comply with Rene's requirements for inclusion.
- Document the SOOT <-> ROOT differences
=> TArray*!

Testing:
- Much, much more testing...
- Specifically expose more guts via SOOT::API for unit testing.
=> joincproto and friends
=> global variable tools


BUGS:
- delete doesn't work as expected:
$ $g = TGraph->new(1, [1.],[1.])
$TGraph1 = \do { my $v = 79536896 };
bless( $TGraph1, 'TGraph' );
$ $g2 = $g->as('TGraph')
$TGraph1 = \do { my $v = 79536896 };
bless( $TGraph1, 'TGraph' );
$ $g3 = $g->as('TGraph')
$TGraph1 = \do { my $v = 79536896 };
bless( $TGraph1, 'TGraph' );
$ $g3->delete;
$ $g3
INT
$ print Dumper $g
$VAR1 = bless( do{\(my $o = 79536896)}, 'TGraph' );
$ print Dumper $g2
$VAR1 = bless( do{\(my $o = 79536896)}, 'TGraph' );
$ print Dumper $g3
