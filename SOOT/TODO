Wrapper / guts:
- Implement global function wrapping
- Implement method caching
- Implement can()
- Fix Color_t lookup and other primitive types
  (Note: I might have fixed this by accident. SetLineColor(int) now works. Does GetLineColor?)
- Investigate wrapping all/more enums
- Investigate array conversion vs. memory (perl->C seems okay. Check C->perl)
- Investigate references
- Implement TTree/Branch (arguments-as-return-values)
- Implement TList? / TFile::GetListOfKeys? => see examples/Basic/bill.pl 
- Assignment operators
  => Specifically, consider "gRandom = new TRandom(...);" in C.
     There is no equivalent in Perl beacuse "$gRandom = TRandom->new()" will
     just overwrite the Perl object and the ROOT objects will internally
     use the C-level gRandom which is no longer referenced by $gRandom.
  => General solution is a proper cross-language memory
     management / ownership setup (PyROOT?)
  => Reasonably simple stop-gap solution would be, for example, to
     overload CODE dereferencing for TObjects to behave as assignment operators.
     The above C code could become: "$gRandom->(...)".
  ====> While mostly implemented now, this still fails on the const qualifier. Doh.
- Auto-convert TArrayD argument types to Double_t*'s on demand
  (same for other TArray*)
- Either lose the silly overloading or add string overloading to get the refaddr

Packaging:
- Investigate ROOT's build system and how SOOT could be integrated
  without sacrificing CPAN-installation. (Specifically, investigate
  inlining of dependencies.)
  => Inline dependencies (Done)
  => Make inlined dependencies work! (Probably takes a conversion to
     Module::Build!)

Documentation / UI:
- Convert more examples and fix the ensuing madness.
- Auto-Convert examples/ to POD?
- Check existing examples/ for FIXME's.
- ROOTSYS/tutorials to comply with Rene's requirements for inclusion.
- Document the SOOT <-> ROOT differences
=> TArray*!

Testing:
- Much, much more testing...
- Specifically expose more guts via SOOT::API for unit testing.
=> joincproto and friends
=> global variable tools
