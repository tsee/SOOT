Revision history for Perl extension SOOT.

0.04  Fri Feb 26 21:00:00 2010
  - Memory leak fixes.
  - Inlined copy of toolchain => Doesn't fully work for building
    the src/ subdirectory yet.
  - Examples now also shipped as documentation.
  - Manual casting with $axis->as('TAxis')
    This is sometimes necessary to work around mistakes in
    the type inference.
  - $obj->keep() to manually mark an object as "do not free this
    on behalf of Perl".
  - Expose $gEnv.
  - Expose SOOT::Init(bool) which intializes the underlying TCint
    and (if bool is true) load the .rootrc logon macros (C!).
  - Inheritance-respecting, recursive class generation.
  - SOOT::Load(className, ...) for exposing extra ROOT classes to
    Perl.
  - Pointer-table state can be dumped for debugging (see GC
    item below).
  - Added complete reference counting "garbage collector"
    or rather ROOT<->Perl memory interface a la PyROOT's
    TMemoryRegulator.

0.03  Sun Feb 21 21:00:00 2010
  - Many more examples.
  - Lazy initialization of ROOT globals (gPad!)
  - Constants actually work now.
  - gBenchmark
  - TH1* doesn't inherit from TArray in the wrapper - for now.
  - TArray* construction from Perl arrays:
     my $tarrayd = TArrayD->new([1., 2., ...]);
  - More tests!

0.02  Sat Feb 20 17:30:00 2010
  - List of candidate methods shown on bad method invocation.
  - Fixed problems with globals (gROOT, etc) and global
    interpreter destruction.
  - Implemented wrapping of more globals: gStyle, gDirectory,
    gROOT, gSystem, etc.
  - A bunch of examples (some working, some not yet) in examples/
  - Recognize "short" as integer type.
  - Fixed memory leak of array-of-basic-type arguments and return
    types.
  - Fixed MethodInfo leak.
  - Reference/Pointer equality. "const" references still to-do.
  - More Perl-SOOT API: Class name iterator.
  - Allow export of various constants/enums such as kRed, kTRUE, etc.
